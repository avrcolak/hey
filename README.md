# hey!
For now, just a dependencies included port of the GGPO VectorWar sample app to
SDL2 and Dear ImGui. As is, compiles only with MSVC and runs only on Windows.
An attempt has also been made at separating the client from the game. Intended
to grow into a a multi-target game emulator-like game platform. For this to
happen GGPO needs to mature, or otherwise be subsumed.
